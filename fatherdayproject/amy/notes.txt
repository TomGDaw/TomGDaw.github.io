I wouldn't be half the reader I am today if I didn't have a dad who was also a reader. Thanks for all of the wonderful stories you've introduced me to over the years and also the ones you made up yourself (those were always fun). I look forward to reading all the books you got me for my birthday and am so far really enjoying The Wind in the Willows. Happy Father's Day!
