            <p>We have no shortage of fun memories over the years. But some of the best that stick out are the hikes
                we've been on. As far back as I can remember to our days in West Virginia you always took us hiking, and
                we are so much the better off for it. It was a consistent experience you provided for us growing up and
                one that we've continued as a tradition well into adulthood over the last decade. Many of the photos
                we've taken on those hikes you have copies of from recent years, so here are a couple from a while back
                that you might not have seen (or at least haven't seen in some time). </p>
            <p>Regardless of what we do to celebrate Father's Day in the years to come, we'll no doubt have fun walks
                and hikes to look forward to all along the way. </p>
