Happy Father's Day, Dad!

We have no shortage of fun memories over the years. But some of the best that stick out are the hikes we've been on. As far back as I can remember to our days in West Virginia you always took us hiking, and we are so much the better off for it. It was a consistent experience you provided for us growing up and one that we've continued as a tradition well into adulthood over the last decade. Many of the photos we've taken on those hikes you have copies of from recent years, so here are a couple from a while back that you might not have seen (or at least haven't seen in some time). 

Regardless of what we do to celebrate Father's Day in the years to come, we'll no doubt have fun walks and hikes to look forward to all along the way.
